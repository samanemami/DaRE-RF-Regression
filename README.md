# Regression Variant of [Original Model Name]

## Overview
This repository contains a regression-based variant of the original model developed by [Jonathan Brophy and Daniel Lowd](https://github.com/jjbrophy47/dare_rf) 
as described in [Machine Unlearning for Random Forests](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v139/brophy21a/brophy21a.pdf). 
The main objective of this variant is to adapt the original architecture for regression tasks that require continuous output prediction. 
The original model, designed for classification tasks, has been modified to support regression problems by changing the loss function and modifying the related methods.

## Key Features
- **Regression-based architecture**: Modified the original classification DaRE RF architecture to handle regression tasks.


# Acknowledgments

I would like to thank [Machine Unlearning for Random Forests](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v139/brophy21a/brophy21a.pdf) for their groundbreaking work on [DaRE], which served as the foundation for this project.
